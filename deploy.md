### Deploying to Cloud Foundry

###### Only of interest to 18F team members

If you donâ€™t already have one, request a Cloud Foundry account in #devops
in Slack and download the Cloud Foundry CLI according to the instructions here:
https://docs.18f.gov/getting-started/setup/

To start, target the org and space you want to work with. For example, if you wanted to work with the staging space:
`cf target -o oasis -s calc-dev`

Manifest files, which contain import deploy configuration settings, are located
in the [manifests](manifests/) directory of this project.

#### CF Structure
- Organization: `oasis`
- Spaces: `calc-dev`, `calc-prod`
- Apps:
  - calc-dev space:
    - calc-dev
- Routes:
  - calc-dev.apps.cloud.gov -> calc-dev space, calc-dev app

#### Environment Variables

For cloud.gov deployments, this project makes use of a
[User Provided Service (UPS)][UPS] to get its configuration
variables, instead of using the local environment. You will need to create a
UPS called `calc-env`, provide 'credentials' to it, and link it to the
application instance. This will need to be done for every Cloud Foundry `space`.

First, create a file with a name like `credentials-staging.json` with all the configuration values specified as per the "Environment Variables" section of
[`README.md`][]:

```json
{
  "SECRET_KEY": "my secret key",
  "...": "other environment variables"
}
```

Then enter the following commands (assuming you already have an application
instance named `calc-dev`):

```sh
cf cups calc-env -p credentials-staging.json
cf bind-service calc-dev calc-env
cf restage calc-dev
```

You can update the user provided service with the following commands:

```sh
cf uups calc-env -p credentials-staging.json
cf restage calc-dev
```

#### Staging Server

The staging server updates automatically when changes are merged into the
`develop` branch. Check out the `deploy` section of [.travis.yml](.travis.yml)
for details and settings.

Should you need to, you can push directly to calc-dev.apps.cloud.gov with:

`cf push -f manifests/manifest-staging.yml`

Remember to target the `calc-dev` space first (`cf target -s calc-dev`).

#### Your Own Server

If you want to deploy to your own sandbox, e.g. for the purpose of deploying a branch you're working on, see the wiki page on [How to Deploy to your Sandbox](https://github.com/18F/calc/wiki/How-to-Deploy-to-your-Sandbox).

There is an example sandbox manifest at [manifests/manifest-sandbox.yml](manifests/manifest-sandbox.yml)

#### Production Servers

TODO Production application development once determined
