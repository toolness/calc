mission: >
  CALC is a tool that enables government contracting personnel to conduct market research on professional service labor categories more quickly and easily.  It helps save the government money by allowing the acquisition community to make more informed decisions when buying professional services.
description: >
  The Contract Awarded Labor Category (CALC) tool helps the federal contracting community make smarter, faster buying decisions by allowing them to search for hourly labor rates across numerous government contracts. The CALC tool is helping contracting officers move from paper-based research to simple, efficient online search.
impact: >
  Saves contracting officers in the federal government hours of work every week and provides them with better data. By having a tool that understands fair and reasonable prices, contracting officers will be better equipped to negotiate with vendors, which will ensure that the government is spending taxpayer dollars wisely and in the most efficient way.
